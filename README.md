I have created a Real Time Chat Application using React.Js for front-end part and node.js for back-end part and use web socket to communicate the different users with each other. I have used Visual Studio Code which is an free to use editor tool for all the languages. The messages are stored in the browser’s localStorage so that users can see their chat history even after refreshing the page. This ensures that conversations are not lost when the page is reloaded. Each user is assigned a unique identifier to distinguish between different participants in the chat. The sender’s name is displayed above each message, making it clear who sent which message. Just problem is that the message will recieve to other users after they reload the webpage. The chat interface is designed to work smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices. The layout adjusts automatically to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience across devices. Sent messages appear on the right side while received messages appear on the left. A timestamp is displayed for each message, showing when it was sent. While building this project I have faced many issues like after installing the react and all where to navigate, where to put, what code I have to write on the terminal to make this work, why there are so much file, why am I getting so much npm related errors and now also I only know a little bit that's why I have taken help from online sources like youtube and chatgpt as I have the knowledge about HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript but don't have any knowledge about React, Node and what is websocket and why and how it is working to communicate different users with each other. And someother problems I have faced like sometimes, messages would appear twice if the sender’s UI updated before the server responded so with help of AI I have implemented a check to prevent duplicate messages from being added to the chat. Things I have learned from it- I have gained a little knowledge about how real-time communication between clients and servers are done, what to use to store the messages so if the user reloads the webpage by mistake the messages will save and donot completely wiped out which provides a seamless user experience. In this I have used two buttons one "Send" for sending the message to the server and other "Clear Chat" for clearing the whole message stored in the local storage. In future I plan to completely learn about the back-end and will add features like end-to-end encryption for privacy, features like sharing different format of files, support multiple chat rooms with different participants and more things which is kinda similar to whatsapp, telegram or anyother chat application.
